        <p style="text-align: left">It is my hypothesis that the circles which are green will typically
            be the highest on the y axis because I believe the happier I am, the more Youtube videos I consume which
            means more minutes spent on Youtube. By tracking my daily mood and how many minutes I spend on Youtube on
            that same day I can start to see if my hypothesis is conclusive on inconclusive based off of patterns and
            trends discovered once more data is collected.</p>
